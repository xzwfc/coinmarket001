# web scrapping
# do not hack the website's server, get things that we could get from the website directly.
# websites that are coded by HTML 
# save the website (which contains javascript (for website logic, do things behind what we see, eg posts on Facebook, click on button to get something, js could also record and detect if you are a rebot or a program),
# css (visualisation, fonts, formats, positions), html (texts language), assets (are not numbers, databases, videos, audios, pictures, files etc.) )
# separate the request the website and parse parts to avoid multiple requests
# chrome (inspect and view source)
